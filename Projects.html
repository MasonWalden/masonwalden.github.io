        <h1>Some of my Projects:</h1>
        <h2>IBC</h2>
        <p>For my IBC group, 16 students were assigned to create an entire company and sell a certain product over the course of the semester. I was the cheif community officer whuch meant that I was in charge of deciding where we would do service hours and where we would donate our profits at the end of the semester. At the end of the semster, we had raised over $11,000 by selling air freshners and donated over 1,100 hours as a team.</p>
        <h2>Databases</h2>
        <p>For my databases project, we were assigned to create an entire database of dummy data and then go through and be able to create Queries to get the information we were looking for. This gave me the experience of know what goes into creating and maintaing a database.</p>
        <h2>Feild Project</h2>
        <p>I was assigned to a group where we worked in a consultant-type role for the company FIS Global. They wanted to know what they could do to automate some of their data processes for call centers that they employ. One of their biggest things was that they wished to have some kind of predictive analytics and at teh end of the semester, we suggested that they go with Salesforce Service Cloud.</p>
